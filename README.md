After many months of trials and improvements, I was able to design, build and run a 3D printer of my idea that has been tested for half a year. This is one of the reasons why I decided to give the entire project to all interested parties. The project is largely based on the very good printers of the VoronDesign team. The presented project has a working area of x215 y140 z220, corexy kinematics and an implemented closed chamber. The Z axis is driven by a GT2 9mm belt and the entire drive has been designed to fit within the contour of the profiles. I designed a printer in DesignSpark Mechanical. The project file is also shared.
