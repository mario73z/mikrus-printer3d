	After many months of trials and improvements, I was able to design, build and run a 3D printer of my idea that has been tested for half a year. This is one of the reasons why I decided to give the entire project to all interested parties.
The design is largely based on the excellent printers of the VoronDesign team. The presented project is a printer with a working area of x215 y140 z220, corexy kinematics and an implemented closed chamber. I am very happy with the Z axis solution. It is driven by the GT2 9mm belt. I was trying to design so that the drive transmission elements fit within the contour of the profiles. Everything is controlled by the clipper software.
I designed a printer in DesignSpark Mechanical. The project file is also shared.
